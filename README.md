# Transactive Energy Service System (TESS)

As the share of renewable resources grows, the marginal cost of energy resources tends to zero, and the long term average cost of energy is increasingly dominated by cost of flexibility resources, and the cost of associated capacity.  Nearly all the existing work on Transactive Energy Systems is based on the retail analogy to wholesale energy markets, which are fundamentally designed around marginal cost pricing of energy resources (and constraints on associated capacity), not on the cost of other grid services.  The goal of the Transactive Energy Service System (TESS) project to design, develop, test, and validate retail-level Transactive Energy systems that are dominated by behind-the-meter renewable energy resources and energy storage resources.  
 
Some of the research questions the project seeks to address include the following: 

(1) Is it possible to use the current model of Transactive Energy systems when the marginal cost of energy is often zero? 

(2) How can a Transactive system design reflect ramping and capacity costs in real time? 

(3) How do alternative Transactive Energy market designs affect the stability, reliability and resilience of power systems? 

(4) How do Transactive Energy systems compare to and work with flat rate or subscription billing in retail settings? 

(5) What new outcomes, features, and benefits emerge for utilities and customers who subscribe to Transactive Energy tariffs? 

(6) What are the economic impacts, e.g., distributional outcomes, that arise from these market design choices?
