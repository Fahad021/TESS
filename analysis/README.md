# Base model

# System 

The system simulation is run from `system.glm`. The output is shown in `system.png`.

# Ramp-up 

The ramp-up simulation is run from `ramp_up.glm`. The output is shown in `ramp_up.png`.

# Ramp-down 

The ramp-down simulation is run from `ramp_down.glm`. The output is shown in `ramp_down.png`.

# Noise 

The noisy load simulation is run from `noise.glm`.  It includes a ramp-up component and the output is shown in `noise.png`

# Market

There are three market simulations, one with only power capacity, one with power capacity and energy storage, and one with power capacity, energy storage, and ramping rate.

## Power Capacity

The power market simulation is run from `power.glm`. The output is shown in `power.png`.

## Energy Storage

The power capacity and energy storage market simulation is run from `energy.glm`. The output is shown in `energy.png`.

## Ramping Rate

The power capacity, energy storage, and ramping rate market simulation is run from `ramp.glm`. The output is shown in `ramp.png`.
